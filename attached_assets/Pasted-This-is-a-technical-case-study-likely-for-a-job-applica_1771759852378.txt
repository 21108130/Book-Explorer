This is a technical case study, likely for a job application, where you are tasked with building a fully functional mobile application called "Book Explorer" from scratch using React Native and Expo. The primary goal of the app is to allow users to easily search for books and view detailed information about them, including professional reviews and ratings. You will be building a cross-platform app (with a focus on Android) that acts as a digital catalog, pulling all its data from public sources on the internet. The final product must be well-documented, tested, and easy for an evaluator to run on their own Android device [citation:0].

Core Functional Requirements (What the App Must Do)
Your app needs to accomplish several key tasks. First, it must successfully fetch and display book information by integrating with a public API like the Open Library API or Google Books API. For each book, the app should clearly show the title, author(s), publication year, and a cover image [citation:0]. Second, to provide richer detail, the app must integrate a second API for ratings, specifically the New York Times Books API, to fetch and display professional user ratings and reviews alongside the basic book information [citation:0]. The cornerstone of the user experience is a dynamic search feature. You must implement a search bar that allows users to type in a book title or author's name, and the list of results should update in real-time as they type, without needing to press a separate "Search" button [citation:0].

User Interface & Interaction Flow
You are not free to design the user interface yourself; you must strictly follow the provided Figma design file. This design will dictate the layout, color scheme, typography, and overall look and feel of every screen in your app [citation:0]. The interaction flow should be intuitive and standard for such applications. The main screen will contain the search bar and a list of results. When a user taps or clicks on any book from this list, the app must navigate to a dedicated details screen . This navigation is a critical interaction point. On this new screen, the user should see the more comprehensive information for that specific book, including its description, full details, and the ratings fetched from the NYTimes API, providing a complete view of the selected item [citation:0].

Technical Implementation Stack & Guidelines
Your technical approach is strictly defined. The project must be built using React Native with TypeScript, not plain JavaScript, to ensure type safety and code quality [citation:0]. You are required to use Expo as your development toolchain and framework, which simplifies the build process. For navigation between the search screen and the book detail screen, you must implement a library like React Navigation, specifically using a Stack Navigator to manage the screen transitions and pass the book data from one screen to the next . This involves setting up your main App.tsx file to define the navigation structure (e.g., a 'Search' screen and a 'BookDetail' screen) . When a book item is pressed, your code will use this navigator to push the detail screen onto the stack, passing the selected book's data along as a parameter so the detail screen knows what to display .

Error Handling, Testing, and Deliverables
Robustness is key. You must implement proper error handling for all network requests to the APIs. This means using .catch() blocks or try/catch syntax in your asynchronous functions to gracefully manage scenarios where the API is down, the network is unavailable, or a search returns no results. Instead of the app crashing, you must display meaningful error messages to the user, such as "Failed to load books. Please check your connection." [citation:0]. Furthermore, you are expected to write unit tests for the critical components and logic of your app, such as the functions that call the APIs or components that render book information, to ensure they work correctly [citation:0].

Finally, you have a list of concrete items you must submit or "deliver." This includes a clean, well-organized GitHub repository with your entire codebase and clear commit history. The repository must contain a detailed README.md file that explains how to set up the project, install dependencies (like npm install), and run it on a device or emulator [citation:0]. You also need to create a screen recording video that walks through the app's features, demonstrating the search functionality, the navigation to the detail screen, and the display of ratings. Most importantly, you must provide an APK (Android Package Kit) file – which is the installable file for Android – so the evaluators can easily install and test your completed app on their own Android phones [citation:0].
